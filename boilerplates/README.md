# Quickstarter Code Boilerplates

This folder contains all the code boilerplates, e.g. for Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot - growing list

These boilerplates are cloned and amended with the right `project specifics` thru the 
various [rundeck jobs](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters/tree/master/rundeck-jobs), 
that are triggered from the [provision application](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app).

If you commit a new boilerplate - please also add a `README.md` based on this [template](../__QS_BOILERPLATE_TEMPLATE_README.md)
