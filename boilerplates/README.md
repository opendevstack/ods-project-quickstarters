# Quickstarter Code Boilerplates

This folder contains all the code boilerplates, e.g. for Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot - growing list

These boilerplates are cloned and amended with the right `project specifics` thru the 
various [rundeck jobs](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters/tree/master/rundeck-jobs), 
that are triggered from the [provision application](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app).
