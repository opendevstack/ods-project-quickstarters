# Backend Node (be-node-express)

## Purpose of this quickstarter (use this when you want to ...)
This is a [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6) quick starter with [express](https://expressjs.com/) using [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
If you are doing non-blocking operation and does not have heavy algorithm/Job which consumes lots of CPU power, this could be an ideal fit.
It contains the basic setup for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) and [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).

## What files / architecture is generated?
The files are generated using a [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator for [node-express-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-node-express-typescript). Generated files include a minimal express server with dummy routes.

## Frameworks used
1.  [Express (^4.15)](https://expressjs.com/)
2.  [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) & [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for Unit Testing
3.  [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter
1. Do a `npm install` form the project root to install all the dependencies.
2. `npm run serve` will transpile the code and start the server
3. Execute `npm run test` for unit testing

## How this quickstarter is built thru jenkins
The build pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the project root. The mains stages of the pipeline are, 
1.  Build :  `npm run build` command will be executed to build the application and then the build (including the node_modules) will be copied to the `docker/dist` folder. 
2.  Unit Testing : `npm test -- --progress false` & `npm run coverage` commands will be executed for running unit tests and to generate coverage report. The results can be seen form the Jenkins console output.

## Builder Slave used 
This quickstarter uses
[Nodejs8-Angular builder slave](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters/tree/master/jenkins-slaves/nodejs8-angular) Jenkins builder slave.

## Known limitations
