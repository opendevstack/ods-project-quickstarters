#### Features

- Bundle Size analysis
  
## Getting Started

1. To run, go to project folder and run

`$ npm install`
or
`$ yarn install` (if you are using yarn)

2. Now start dev server by running -

`$ npm run start`
or
`$ yarn start`

3. visit - http://localhost:8080/

To create production ready codes -

`$ npm run build`

4. Analyze source code / bundle size

`$ npm run analyze`

for more commands refer `package.json`


## Roadmap

Before starting development please go through -

- [Presentational and Container Components
](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
- [All the fundamental React.js concepts, jammed into this single Medium article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-the-fundamental-react-js-concepts-jammed-into-this-single-medium-article-c83f9b53eac2)
- [Tips to learn React + Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/tips-to-learn-react-redux/)
- [When do I know Iâ€™m ready for Redux?](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f)

## Code structure

Refer `src/home/` module for an ideal directory structure

Project uses `Domain-style` for code structure-

Domain-style : separate folders per feature or domain, possibly with sub-folders per file type

For more details refer `/src/home` folder.

Reference -

- http://redux.js.org/docs/faq/CodeStructure.html
- http://engineering.kapost.com/2016/01/organizing-large-react-applications/

#### Common components

Place all common components such as Header/Footer in `src/common/components` folder.


### Adding new Module/Feature

- Create a Module/Feature folder at `src/`
like - - `src/home`
Feature folder must contain file named `index.js` at root

Like -

- `src/home/index.js`

Next as per need, add sub folders like -

- `src/home/reducers/`
- `src/home/epics/`
- `src/home/containers/`
- `src/home/components/`



### State handling

- We bundle reducers, actions, seletors, operations and types in one "duck" style cluster to reduce overhead, the ducks are located in reducers folder (read more: 
https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be)
- Create folder named `reducers` inside Feature folder like - `src/home/reducers`
- Place `index.js` which combines all reducers using `combineReducers`

### Epics

- Create folder named `epics` inside feature/domain folder like - `src/home/epics`
- Place `index.js` which combines all epics using `combineEpics`

## Ajax Handling

This boilerplate comes with `rxjs` to handle ajax. Additionally as per need we can use other libs like `axios`.

Using Rxjs DOM api for ajax see file - `rxjs/observable/dom/ajax`
[AjaxObservable](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/file/es6/observable/dom/AjaxObservable.js.html)

## Styling

We are using CSS-in-JS solution which comes bundled with material-ui. 
Read more about it at https://material-ui.com/css-in-js/basics/

## Analyzing the Bundle Size

We can Analyze and debug JavaScript (or Sass or LESS) code bloat through source maps and [source-map-explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) great tool for this.

The source map explorer determines which file each byte in your minified code came from. It shows you a treemap visualization to help you debug where all the code is coming from.

To analyzing bundle, run command -

`$ npm run analyze` / `$ yarn analyze`

## Deployment

Refer [deployment](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment) section from CRA doc.
